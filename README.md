Learning Computer Graphics from various different courses, including topics like OpenGL, software rendering and others.

## Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++

Udemy course: [[link]](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/)

Using **GLAD* + GLFW
- ✅ Create 3D graphical applications using C++ and OpenGL
- ✅ Use and understand GLEW and GLFW
- ✅ Draw 3D objects to a window
- ✅ Use OpenGL shaders (vertex, fragment and even geometry shaders!)
- ✅ Use and understand uniform variables
- Use the GLM (OpenGL Maths) library for 3D transforms
- Translate, Rotate and Scale 3D objects
- Understand and use the concepts of interpolation to streamline 3D applications
- Use Indexed Draws to simplify 3D model construction
- Understand and use both orthogonal and perspective projections
- Implement a user controlled camera to navigate 3D worlds using keyboard and mouse input
- Apply textures to 3D models to give them more detail
- Apply the Phong Lighting model to add realistic lighting to a 3D scene
- Use three types of light: Direction, Point and Spot Lights (and have multiple Point/Spot Lights in a scene!)
- Import 3D models made in external applications such as Blender and 3DSMax using the Assimp library
- Apply both Directional Shadows and Omnidirectional Shadows
- Shadow Mapping optimisation techniques
- How to apply MULTIPLE Omnidirectional Shadow sources to a scene
- Implement a Skybox to increase the scope of a 3D scene using cubemaps
